# Sugo
A web app that will allow you to make money making small errands.

### How it works?
The app will work the same way as a freelancing site but instead of having access to all jobs globally, it looks at your location and suggest small errands that a user can work on.

### Who can create errands?
On other hand, users also has the ability to create tasks/errands. Of course, they will have to pay for the other user whom they will choose to do the work.

### Selecting who will work on an errand
When looking for an errand, users will have to make a bid to a specific task. The user who made the task will have the ability to select whom he/she likes to work on his/her task.
